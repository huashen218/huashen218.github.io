        <p>I am interested in general area of <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>HCI</strong>.
            My current research focuses on <strong>improving human-centric deep learning interpretability</strong> for <strong>natural language processing</strong> and <strong>computer vision</strong> applications,
            such as <em>generating visual and text explanation for deep learning</em> and <em>evaluating AI explanation from human perspective</em>. Revolving the goal, my current topics include:

        <li class="publist">
            <span>Explainable AI (XAI), Human-AI Interaction, AI Model Robustness.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="publist">
            <span>Dialogue Systems, Question Answering, Natural Language Reasoning, Knowledge Graph.</span>

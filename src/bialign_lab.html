            We have <b>several PhD openings</b>, and are looking for self-motivated PhD students joining in 2026!
            <li>
                <b>PhD Program:</b>
                You can apply for either <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/phd/">NYU Courant (NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science)</a> or <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">NYU Tandon (NYU Tandon School of Engineering)</a>, and express your interest in being associated with <b>NYU Shanghai</b>. 
                The final admission decision is made by the NYU committee.
                For more details regarding the program, please visit the <a href="https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/graduate/computer-science-phd-program">Computer Science Ph.D. Program link</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Flexibility in Locations and Future Careers (US or China):</b>
                You will spend <b>Year 1 at NYU New York Campus</b> to finish PhD courses. Starting from <b>Year 2</b>, you can <b>choose your location</b> working with me in Shanghai, New York, or remotely.
                For non-US citizens, students are <b>eligible for F1 OPT</b> after graduation, offering opportunities to work in the US.

                <b>Competitive Stipends:</b>
                Based on my limited understanding, the stipends offered to PhD students are competitive. If students are based in Shanghai, they receive a monthly stipend of around 1700 USD. 
                If they are based in New York, the stipend increases to around 3500 USD per month.
